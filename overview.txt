Idea: voice to RF Curtain opener which uses machine learning to detect who is saying it based on gender and what the objectice is.

First design: RF controlled curtain opener
Components needed for first design:
  RF-remote(transmitter)
  RF receiver + microcontroller (control logic / safety)
  Motor + gearbox (drive) and mechanical transmission (belt, spool, pulleys)
  Motor driver / H-bridge / power stage
  Power supply (battery or mains → DC)
  Sensors & safety (limit switches, end stops, obstacle detect)
  Mechanical mount, rails, couplings, enclosure, antenna
  Optional: position encoder, current sense, user interface (buttons, LEDs, smartphone)

First steps: Dev-kit solution
1. RF-transmitter and reciver
2. Motor and motordriver
3. MCU (control logic)
